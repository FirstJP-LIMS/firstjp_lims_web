BILLING FLOW IN CLINICAL LABS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Patient arrives → Tests ordered → Lab performs tests → Billing determined by:

1. INSURANCE/HMO (Most common in Nigeria)
   - Patient has HMO card
   - Lab bills HMO company monthly
   - HMO pays negotiated rate (e.g., ₦5,000 for FBC instead of ₦8,000 retail)
   - Patient might pay co-payment (e.g., 10%)

2. PATIENT SELF-PAY (Cash)
   - Patient pays full price upfront
   - Gets receipt immediately
   - Payment before sample collection

3. CORPORATE ACCOUNT (Credit)
   - Companies have monthly accounts
   - Lab bills company at month-end
   - Used for employee wellness programs
   - Payment terms: 30-60 days

4. GOVERNMENT/NHIS
   - National Health Insurance Scheme patients
   - Government reimburses lab quarterly
   - Often lowest rates but delayed payment
