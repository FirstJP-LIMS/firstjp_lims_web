I want you to act as a senior frontend developer. Your task is to design a robust landing-page for a Learning Management System (LMS) focused on Medical Laboratory and Health-related courses. The landing page must be: Minimalistic, professionally structured and Optimized for conversion (enroll, explore courses, become a student)

Brand Color is gradients of navy blue, red, black, white.
Include sections such as:
   * Header
   * Hero section
   * Key value propositions
   * Featured medical laboratory courses
   * How it works
   * Why study with us
   * Testimonials (dummy data)
   * CTA to become a student
   * Footer (simple + clean)


Interactions + micro-interactions** achievable with **Vanilla JavaScript only** (e.g., mobile menu toggle, course hover effects, scroll reveal suggestions).
Then output the final deliverable:
   A clean, minimal landing page code scaffold (HTML + Tailwind + DaisyUI + Vanilla JS)
   All sections included but content can be placeholder/dummy
   No backend, no build tools — pure HTML + Tailwind CDN
   Production-ready structure that I can later modify.
Please - Avoid verbosity.
