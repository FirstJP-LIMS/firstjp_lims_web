Working on multi-tenants application for a laboratory information management system, I have successfully extended the project to entertain sub-domain hosting, tenant admin can login to the platform and perform operation. 
Now, I want to work on the management of patients, lab staffs, clinicians, and other possible users - authentication process through the tenant's subdomain url, so all users are unique to the vendor's subdomain.
I am working on a setup such that patient can register under multiple vendor, i.e. a patient can patronize direct vendors..

I have the core and tenant apps managing the tenanting and the account is managing authentication process, I will share my code with you, what exist for reviews and further development... I hope you got it, before I share scripts with you, please explain the aim back to me, just to be sure.
